## Overview

Building a dynamic and responsive Age Calculator app

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

## My process

It was a fun, interesting and educative process and it was<br>
calculation intensive too. It put my critical thinking abilities to<br>
the test. It also put my styling ablilites to the test. <br>

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Being a good programmer or a front-end developer requires skill, <br>
hard work determination, there were times when i felt like <br>
giving up, but I had in mind that i have goals to achieve, <br>
so as to keep my dreams alive. If thers one thing i learned <br>
is to always put in yor best to achieve your goals.

### Continued development

There is still a lot of areas that need to be improved CSS and JS wise, <br>
but with practive I know i get there,
